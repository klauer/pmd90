## configure/RELEASE: Location of external products

# Run "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the application top
# directory whenever this file is changed or any external module
# pointed to by this RELEASE file is rebuilt.

# If you don't want to install files into $(TOP) then define
# INSTALL_LOCATION_APP here:
#INSTALL_LOCATION_APP=<fullpathname>

# Asyn
ASYN=/usr/lib/epics

# EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can preempt definitions
EPICS_BASE=/usr/lib/epics

# Needs StreamDevice compiled with PCRE support for regex matching
# (alternatively, modify PMD90Sup/devPMD90.proto's read_string)
